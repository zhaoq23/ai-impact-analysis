# 1. Problem Statement
As AI rapidly transforms key industries, public and institutional perceptions play a crucial role in shaping its adoption and regulation. Yet, current understanding of how AI is portrayed in media‚Äîespecially in terms of sentiment and topic focus‚Äîremains fragmented and anecdotal. This project addresses that gap by systematically analyzing over 160,000 AI-related articles using advanced NLP methods, revealing how sentiment varies across time, sectors, technologies, and regions. The goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers navigating the evolving AI landscape.

# 2. Executive Summary
üîß **Data Processing and Methodology**
- Initial dataset of ~200,000 articles was systematically cleaned and filtered to 167,763 relevant samples through a three-stage process incorporating linguistic analysis, feature engineering, and topic modeling
- Implemented a sophisticated sentiment analysis pipeline, starting with VADER analysis for baseline establishment, followed by data enhancement through manual annotation and BLOOM model labeling, then advanced model fine-tuning with RoBERTa and transformer ensemble architecture, ultimately achieving 82% macro-F1 score through class weight and learning rate optimization.
- Enhanced data quality through entity recognition (SpaCy, NER-BERT) and temporal analysis (LDA, BERTopic).
  
üìä **Sentiment Analysis Results**
- Final sentiment distribution showed balanced coverage: 56.1% neutral (88,344 samples), 42.0% positive (66,060 samples), and 1.9% negative (3,045 samples). This balanced distribution effectively separates genuine AI breakthroughs from general market speculation, ensuring more accurate analysis.
- Peak positive sentiment (60%) observed during May-July 2022, indicating significant AI breakthroughs
- Positive sentiments strongly associated with technological advancement and market growth
- Negative sentiments primarily linked to privacy concerns and data security issues

üëâ Notes: My initial methodology aimed to combine manual annotation with ChatGPT-3.5 labeling (15,000 samples, $70 investment) for enhanced accuracy. However, due to a Colab system crash after a full day of training, resulting in data loss, which forced me to adapt to use the free BLOOM model for labeling. This limitation presents an opportunity for future improvements.

üè≠ **Industry and Technology Impact**
- Finance, healthcare, and media sectors demonstrate highest AI automation potential while facing rigorous scrutiny
- Computer Vision dominates positive coverage (40-70%), while Natural Language Processing shows increasing negative sentiment trends
- Major cloud providers (Vertex AI, Azure AI, Google Cloud AI) lead both positive and negative coverage
- Executive positions (CTO, CEO) show increasing AI impact compared to operational roles

üåç **Regional and Organizational Trends**
- Developed countries, particularly European nations, lead AI discussions and implementation
- Tech giants (Microsoft, Google) dominate positive coverage while facing increased scrutiny over AI monopoly concerns
- Regulatory bodies, especially in the EU, emerge prominently in negative coverage, indicating growing oversight focus

# 3. Article Clean-up and Filtering
To ensure the data quality while focusing on business and technology relevant content for efficient analysis, I apply a three-step systemic approach:
**Step 1: Initial Data Cleaning (180,564 samples left)**
- Cleaned various web elements and formatting residuals 
- Removed irrelevant artifacts (URLs, emails, non-ASCII characters) 
- Applied length-based filtering to remove outliers 
- Retained 180,564 articles after initial cleaning

**Step 2: Feature Extraction and Engineering**
- Performed linguistic analysis: 
- Basic text metrics (length, sentence structure)
- Grammatical analysis (parts of speech)
- Entity recognition (companies, products, locations)
- Created composite features for: 
- Technology density, Business relevance, Industry impact
- Applied domain-specific weighting system

**Step 3: Topic Modeling and Refinement (167,763 samples left)**
- Conducted topic analysis for major themes
- Evaluated and optimized topic count
- Selected 8 distinct topics 
- Applied 0.55 probability threshold and 90% retention rate
- Topic distribution after refinement: Topic 0 -11.1%, Topic 1-6.8%; Topic 2 -15.3%; Topic 3 - 20.6%; Topic 4 - 0.3%; Topic 5 - 18.3%; Topic 6 - 7.6%; Topic 7 - 20.1%

# 4. Sentiment Analysis
## 4.1 Steps
- To identify the top reasons for successful data science/AI initiatives, I predicted article sentiments using a multi-stage analysis approach. 
- Initial VADER analysis revealed significant class imbalance (94.1% positive, 5.0% negative, 0.9% neutral), indicating potential classification bias and necessitating a more sophisticated method. 
- I developed a comprehensive framework combining manual annotation (1,000 samples), BLOOM model for semi-supervised learning (10,000 samples), and an ensemble architecture integrating RoBERTa with custom optimization techniques (as shown in the right plot). This approach successfully balanced the dataset and achieved 82% macro-F1 score across all sentiment categories.

üëâ **Note: My annotation framework differentiates between actual AI progress, general industry updates, and critical concerns.**
- Positive: Verified AI breakthroughs and technical achievements with proven results
- Neutral: General AI industry discussions and market outlooks
- Negative: Critical reports on AI risks, failures, and safety concerns

## 4.2 Results 
- My predictive model achieved relatively strong overall performance metrics, with 77.43% accuracy and 82.01% macro-F1 score, showing particularly impressive results for negative sentiment detection (93.69% precision, 98.34% recall).
- After applying the model to the entire dataset, **56.1% were classified as neutral (88,344 samples), 42.0% were classified as positive (66,060 samples), and 1.9% were classified as negative (3,045 samples).**
- This balanced approach successfully overcame typical sentiment analysis challenges, maintaining consistent performance across all sentiment categories (70-98% range) while effectively handling class imbalance, making it a reliable tool for analyzing AI initiative success factors.

## 4.3 Sentiment Analysis Over Time
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/842f479f-c2ee-443c-acfd-8396401cfedb)

- The sentiment analysis reveals that AI development maintains predominantly positive and neutral coverage, collectively accounting for over 95% of discussions. 
- Based on our focus on distinguishing genuine technical achievements from general updates, **significant AI breakthroughs were identified during 2022-05 to 2022-07**, where positive sentiment peaked at nearly 60%. While neutral coverage has fluctuated between 40-60%, negative sentiment has remained consistently low (around 2%), indicating persistent but stable levels of concern about AI development.

## 4.4 Sentiment Analysis with Keyword Pattern
- The word cloud analysis clearly reveals distinct patterns between sentiment categories. 
- In the Positive word cloud, prominent terms included "technology", "market", "business", "artificial", "intelligence", and "company", while the Negative word cloud highlighted terms such as "news", "technology", "say", "video", "privacy", and "data".
